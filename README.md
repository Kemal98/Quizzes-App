# Quizzes-App
This React app allows users to create, edit, delete, and take quizzes. After the user logs in to the application, a table with a list of all quizzes created so far is displayed on the home page, along with buttons to delete and view quizzes.

Clicking on the quiz view button opens a page where each question is displayed as a slide in a slideshow. Each slide shows a question and a button to reveal the answer. This quiz solver does not allow you to actually solve the quiz, but is more like a way for the user to see all the questions in one place.

Clicking on any row in the quiz list table, except for the delete and view quiz buttons, redirects the user to the quiz editing page. Here the user can change the name of the quiz and add, edit and delete questions.

To create a new quiz, the user can click on the button "Create a new quiz" on the home page. Then a form opens in which the user enters the name of the new quiz and adds questions. In order for the user to create a quiz faster, the application offers the possibility to recycle questions from previously created quizzes.

When the user has made all the changes and finished editing the quiz, they can save the quiz by clicking the "Save" button. Also, if a user wants to delete a quiz, they can do so by clicking the delete quiz button on the quiz list page. The deleted quiz will be removed from the system, but the questions that the quiz consisted of will not be deleted, but will remain in the system for later recycling.
